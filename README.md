# BookClubBrothers_Backend_API

The Backend for the Book-Club Brothers website. 

To view the Frontend for the BookClub Brothers website and find out more about the club, click here: https://github.com/DarrellRoberts/BookClubBrothers_Frontend

For the Backend I used Node.js on the Express.js framework.

This also includes my own API which I built and host on MongoDB. 

I deployed this project on Render.

Cheers,

Darrell
