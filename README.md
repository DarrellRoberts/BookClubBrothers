# BookClubBrothers_Backend

The Backend for the Book-Club Brothers website. The Book-Club Brothers is an exclusive book club formed of old school friends, who find themselves dotted all across the globe and are unable to meet in person. Therefore, we meet online instead and have been doing so since 11th October 2020 (the date our whatsapp group was created). We choose the books, read them and then discuss - either over a warm cup of coffee or ice cold beer.

For the Backend I used Node.js on the Express.js framework. I then deployed this repo on Render.

Cheers,
Darrell
